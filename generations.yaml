generations:
  - name: "First Generation (C170; 1998)"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The original Ford Focus was introduced by Ford of Europe in 1998 as a replacement for the Escort, winning the 1999 European Car of the Year award. The Focus Mk 1 was available in three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, five-door estate (wagon), and five-door hatchback (from 2001) body styles. Ford of North America began marketing the Focus in September 1999 for the 2000 model year with market-specific modifications including different engines (2.0L Zetec and 2.0L/2.3L Duratec four-cylinders). The sporty SVT Focus variant featured enhanced performance with a higher-output engine, improved suspension, and distinctive styling. The car was praised for its engaging handling and practical packaging. In 2002, the high-performance Focus RS was launched with a 2.0L turbocharged Duratec engine and was produced in limited numbers (4,501 units between 2002-2003) at the Saarlouis plant in Germany."

  - name: "Second Generation (C307/C170; 2004)"
    start_year: 2004
    end_year: 2011
    description: "The second-generation Focus had two distinct development paths. In Europe (C307), it was launched at the 2004 Paris Motor Show as a replacement for the Mk 1, available as three and five-door hatchback and estate, with a sedan added mid-2005. It featured the same basic suspension design from Mk 1 but with a stiffer bodyshell, was larger and heavier than its predecessor, and introduced new technologies including KeyFree system, solar-reflect windshield, and Bluetooth connectivity. A two-door coupé-cabriolet with retractable hardtop was added in 2007. The Focus ST debuted in 2005 with a 2.5L turbocharged five-cylinder Volvo engine producing 225 bhp. A facelift in 2007-2008 introduced Ford's Kinetic Design philosophy. In 2009, the Focus RS returned with an updated 2.5L engine. For North America (C170 platform), a restyled 2008-2011 generation was introduced, available only as coupe and sedan with hatchbacks and wagons discontinued. The North American version never officially used the 'second generation' designation since it shared the same platform as Mk 1."

  - name: "Third Generation (C346; 2011)"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The third-generation Focus represented Ford's 'One Ford' global product strategy, reuniting international and North American models. Production began in late 2010 with launch in early 2011 simultaneously in North America and Europe. The previous North American version was discontinued in favor of this global platform. Available in sedan, hatchback, and wagon body styles, it featured more expressive styling and significantly improved interior quality. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included a range of efficient four-cylinder engines, including the innovative 1.0L EcoBoost three-cylinder. The high-performance ST model offered performance variants, while the RS returned in 2015 with a 2.3L EcoBoost engine and advanced all-wheel drive system that could send full power to the rear wheels. A significant facelift was previewed at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, featuring a redesigned front end with Ford's new family grille and slimline headlights. The interior showcased improved materials and technology including SYNC 3 infotainment and later MyFord Touch systems. This generation successfully positioned the Focus as a more premium offering in the compact segment with class-leading driving dynamics."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (C519; 2018)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: 2025
    description: "The fourth-generation Focus was unveiled on April 10, 2018, to mark the brand's 20th anniversary, with European and Asian-market versions. The model is available in sedan, hatchback, and estate body styles, with a crossover-inspired 'Active' trim level available for hatchback and estate, and a 'Vignale' luxury trim level. The exterior features a sportier design while the interior is described by Ford as simpler and more minimalist with a floating touchscreen. Technology includes SYNC 3 or SYNC 4 infotainment systems, FordPass Connect, and the CoPilot360 driver assistance suite. In April 2018, Ford announced plans to discontinue all passenger vehicles except the Mustang in the North American market to focus on trucks and SUVs. The Focus Active was intended as the only version for North America, but Ford cancelled these plans in August 2018 due to tariffs on Chinese exports. The car features efficient EcoBoost petrol and EcoBlue diesel engines by market. No fourth-generation RS model was developed due to emissions standards and high development costs. A facelift was introduced in October 2021 for the European market. In 2022, Ford announced it would discontinue the Focus by 2025 as part of a pivot toward crossover vehicles and electrification. Production officially ended in November 2025."
